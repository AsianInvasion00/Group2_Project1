There was no statistical significance found between household demographics and acceptance status
The Americans approved for loans are making an average of $5,201.09 per month
The Americans rejected for loans are making an average of $5,218.15 per month
Low interest rates have induced Americans to pick up their borrowing to a record level, and fewer are finding themselves with severe credit problems such as bankruptcy, foreclosure or debt collection proceedings.
21.8% of the public debt, or $6.87 trillion, is owned by another arm of the federal government itself.
Since the government almost always spends more than it takes in taxes and other revenue, the national debt continues to rise. 
The Congressional Budget Office expects the U.S. government's debt financing costs to increase dramatically by 2052 as a result of rising interest rates and mounting budget deficits. 
For several years, the nationâ€™s debt has been bigger than its gross domestic product, which was 26.13 T in the 4th quarter of 2022
The graph shows a decreasing trend in the TDSP from 2020 to 2022. TDSP is an important economic indicator that measures the amount of income households are using to pay their debts, including mortgages, credit cards, car loans, and other types of debt
TDSP: Total Debts Service Payments.
We can see that TDSP has been increasing steadily over the years, with a slight dip in 2020 due to the pandemic, but has since increased again in 2021. This indicates that Americans are taking on more debt and using a larger portion of their income to pay off that debt.
The median and mean values for 2022 are higher than those of 2020 and 2021, and the mode value for 2022 is the highest among the three years. This could suggest that the data distribution is becoming skewed towards higher values, which may indicate that more households are experiencing higher levels of debt service payments than their disposable personal income.
There is an abnormal increase during the years of 2020 and 2021 approximately 3 million dollars 
The total federal debt has increased at an incredible rate throughout the years of 2018-2022.
Total federal debt
as of December, 1, 2022 is $31,419,689
The percent change for 2020 to 2021 is approximately 15%
The average percent change throughout the graph is 9%
As you can see the total federal debt has increased at an alarming rate. But the rate of change is below the average which shows the increase of debt has finally stabilized after the 2020-2021 spike
